# Toil Reduction

## Identifying and Measuring Toil

### Identifying Toil

* **Repetitive**
    * Ask yourself, how frequently is the task done? Any task you are doing more than several times a week is probably toil.
    * How long does it take to do the task each time? Tasks that take up a good portion of time, even if they happen less frequently, are probably toil.
    * Is there a lot of effort involved in doing the task?
* **Manual**
    * Is human intervention necessary? If an event can be completely handled by a machine without the input of a human, and a person is handling it, then it is toil.
* **Automatable**
    * Any task with a clearly defined set of steps is probably automatable and is therefore toil.
    * You can prevent these types of toil from building up by automating from the start.
* **Stateless**
    * Does it accomplish something meaningful? If a task does not solve a long-term problem but rather just remedies an immediate symptom, then it probably is toil.
    * Is there a long-term and positive change in the end? If the system just returns to the status quo, the task probably is toil.

### Measuring Toil

* Time spent on toil tasks
* Number of toil tasks done
