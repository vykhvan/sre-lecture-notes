    * Servers, storage arrays, load balancers, switches...

    * Even the small pieces matter! (Ex. SSH key)

### Business Critical Applications

* Any application that serves a critical function of the business
* How can you identify these critical applications?
    * Conduct a survey or job shadow different business units
        * Ask: does it make the business money?
        * Ask: if it goes down, what functions stop?
        * Ask: who or what units are impacted when it goes down?
