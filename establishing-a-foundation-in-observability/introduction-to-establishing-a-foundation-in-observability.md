# Introduction to Establishing a Foundation in Observability

**Observability** -- the ability to measure the state of a system by examining its outputs.

## Business Stakeholders

* Development -- you will probably interface with this team the most, as there are a lot of overlapping tasks.
* DevOps -- since DevOps typically owns the delivery of software, they will be interested to know how well it is performing for end users.
* QA -- SRE and QA may have more of a consulting relationship since both teams use automation.
* Support -- this team is on the front line with clients and may need a hand from SRE teams for more technical issues.

## Create an SRE Team

* Form an SRE Team -- identify the roles of the team and determine the ideal size of the team.
* Allocate responsibilities/ownership -- answer "What work is this team responsible for?", and determine how SRE's work is different than other teams.
* Improve stability of a system -- explore skills and methods on how SRE teams help improve system stability.
* Centralize ops workload -- brind the ops workload into one location under one team.
